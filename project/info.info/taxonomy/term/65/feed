 <title>Dogwood Canyon Nature Park</title>
 <link>https://info.info/newsroom/spotlight/dogwood-canyon-nature-park</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-title field-type-ds field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Dogwood Canyon Nature Park&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;Aside from a few amenities to make Dogwood Canyon Nature Park more accessible to our guests, the rugged landscape has been left untouched and, with just a little imagination, you can travel back to a time when European settlers first entered the area or, even further, to explore the mark that Native Americans left on these Missouri hills and hollows.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;The park is owned and managed by the Dogwood Canyon Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the canyon’s natural plant and wildlife environment. The Foundation promotes environmental conservation by maintaining the park and providing the public with an unspoiled setting for exploration and the enjoyment of various outdoor activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The purposes of the Dogwood Canyon Foundation are to promote natural conservation, and to protect the natural environment and its wildlife and plant life by acquiring and maintaining ecologically significant, undeveloped land to benefit the general public. To achieve its purpose, the Foundation owns, operates and maintains Dogwood Canyon Nature Park.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dogwood Canyon Nature Park is a one-of-a-kind experience for nature lovers and adventure seekers of all ages. Covering 10,000 acres of pristine Ozark Mountain landscape, the park has miles of crystal-clear trout streams, cascading waterfalls, ancient burial caves, unique hand-built bridges and bottomless, blue-green pools.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The walls of the jagged ravines frame a dramatic valley bursting with hardwoods, evergreens and of course, the park’s namesake – Dogwoods. The streams hold record trout, and the high meadows that reach into Arkansas provide pasture for small resident herds of long-horned cattle, American bison and elk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Acquired by Bass Pro Shops’ founder Johnny Morris in 1990, the park is managed by the Dogwood Canyon Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the canyon’s natural plant and wildlife environment. The foundation promotes environmental conservation by maintaining the park and providing the public with an unspoiled setting for exploration and the enjoyment of various outdoor activities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are many activities available at Dogwood Canyon Nature Park, all of which are family friendly and professionally managed. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Visit Trentino</title>
 <link>https://info.info/newsroom/spotlight/visit-trentino</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-title field-type-ds field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Visit Trentino&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;Visit Trentino focuses on creating specific public interest by implementing and promoting initiatives and projects aimed at developing tourism in Trentino. In this context it takes on the delicate role of managing and mediating with the aim of channelling the energy and resources operating in the territory to make their actions more effective.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Promoting the “land of the butterflies” above all means knowing how to grasp the challenges of a transforming market, cultivating the ambition to improve the reputation and image of Trentino, its ability to welcome and accommodate people from all over the world, its economic performance connected to tourism flows, to reinforce the Trentino Brand and transmit these values to promote its popularity in the world. To achieve these objectives also depends on innovative products and services such as the multimedia ICT platform and analysis and research relating to international dynamics of the industry which are transmitted to operators in the area to promote a virtuous circle and a synergy of action.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It was founded on the 30 June 2015 by Trentino Sviluppo SpA, a company created by the autonomous Province of Trento to foster sustainable development in the Trentino area. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Browsing through the menus you will find useful contacts and links to help you design a holiday or trip to Trentino as well as brochures that can be consulted online or downloaded.&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It was initiated in 1999 and renewed in 2006. The EU member states also take part in the cooperation in their national capacities. Belarus, which is part of the Baltic Sea catchment area, participates in practical cooperation. The USA and Canada hold observer status in the ND.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;The ND policy aims at supporting stability, well-being and sustainable development in the region by means of practical cooperation. The Northern Dimension covers a wide range of sectors, such as the environment, nuclear safety, health, energy, transport, logistics, promotion of trade and investment, research, education and culture, to name a few.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:14px;&quot;&gt;The Northern Dimension operates through four partnerships; the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP), the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being (NDPHS), the Northern Dimension Partnership on Transport and Logistics (NDPTL) and the Northern Dimension Partnership on Culture (NDPC). The structure, nature and tasks of partnerships vary from project-centered financing to expert-oriented cooperation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Santa Claus declared Rovaniemi as his hometown, he told how his home at Ear Mountain (Korvatunturi) was revealed at the beginning of the last century and how this closely guarded secret spread the world over. In order to retain the privacy of his secret location, the Elf folk decided to build a place where Santa could meet people from near and far at the Northern Arctic Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Claus spends his time at the Santa Claus Village every day of the year to take care of his mission in life; to enhance the wellbeing of children and the kindness of grown-ups, as well as spreading the message love and goodwill of Christmas Spirit throughout the globe. Rovaniemi is The Official Home of Santa Claus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is sure to help get you into the holiday mood!&lt;/p&gt;
