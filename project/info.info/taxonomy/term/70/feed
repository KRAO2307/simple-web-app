 <title>Dogwood Canyon Nature Park</title>
 <link>https://info.info/newsroom/spotlight/dogwood-canyon-nature-park</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-title field-type-ds field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Dogwood Canyon Nature Park&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;Aside from a few amenities to make Dogwood Canyon Nature Park more accessible to our guests, the rugged landscape has been left untouched and, with just a little imagination, you can travel back to a time when European settlers first entered the area or, even further, to explore the mark that Native Americans left on these Missouri hills and hollows.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.008px;&quot;&gt;The park is owned and managed by the Dogwood Canyon Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the canyon’s natural plant and wildlife environment. The Foundation promotes environmental conservation by maintaining the park and providing the public with an unspoiled setting for exploration and the enjoyment of various outdoor activities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The purposes of the Dogwood Canyon Foundation are to promote natural conservation, and to protect the natural environment and its wildlife and plant life by acquiring and maintaining ecologically significant, undeveloped land to benefit the general public. To achieve its purpose, the Foundation owns, operates and maintains Dogwood Canyon Nature Park.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dogwood Canyon Nature Park is a one-of-a-kind experience for nature lovers and adventure seekers of all ages. Covering 10,000 acres of pristine Ozark Mountain landscape, the park has miles of crystal-clear trout streams, cascading waterfalls, ancient burial caves, unique hand-built bridges and bottomless, blue-green pools.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The walls of the jagged ravines frame a dramatic valley bursting with hardwoods, evergreens and of course, the park’s namesake – Dogwoods. The streams hold record trout, and the high meadows that reach into Arkansas provide pasture for small resident herds of long-horned cattle, American bison and elk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Acquired by Bass Pro Shops’ founder Johnny Morris in 1990, the park is managed by the Dogwood Canyon Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the canyon’s natural plant and wildlife environment. The foundation promotes environmental conservation by maintaining the park and providing the public with an unspoiled setting for exploration and the enjoyment of various outdoor activities.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are many activities available at Dogwood Canyon Nature Park, all of which are family friendly and professionally managed. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>The Thunderbolts Project</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-title field-type-ds field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;dc:title&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Thunderbolts Project&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The Thunderbolts Project is the collaborative voice of the Electric Universe movement established in 2004. It is a trademark of the non-profit T-Bolts Group Inc. Its prime mission is to explore the Electric Universe paradigm. Historical and current discoveries in the sciences emphasize the dynamic role of the electromagnetic force in nature, from quantum worlds and biological systems to planetary, stellar, and galactic domains.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With the growing Internet presence of The Thunderbolts Project, it places a spotlight on interdisciplinary research, direct observation, and experimental work confirming the pervasive role of the electric force in nature. Founder and director is David Talbott. Chief science advisor is the Australian physicist Wallace Thornhill.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Among its many activities, The Thunderbolts Project publishes educational books and videos, sponsors meetings and conferences, and produces a comprehensive website featuring the Thunderbolts Picture of the Day (TPOD), the Essential Guide to the Electric Universe, a public forum and much more. In addition, it promotes groundbreaking research, free from all ties to academic, corporate, or governmental institutions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

An executive order was issued calling for a mandatory statewide 25% reduction in urban water use. Californians have had to get creative and form new habits of water usage quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sfwater.info/index.aspx?page=136&quot;&gt;sfwater.info&lt;/a&gt;, the site of San Francisco Water Power Sewer, has a section dedicated to practical &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfwater.info/index.aspx?page=136&quot;&gt;water conversation tips&lt;/a&gt; at home (taking shorter showers, replacing old toilets, etc.); at the office (following a water conversation checklist, putting up workplace signage, etc.) , and with landscaping (attending special workshops, getting a water-wise gardening guide, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have control on when the drought will be over, but we – residents and visitors – can all get our feet wet &lt;em&gt;(figuratively speaking of course!)&lt;/em&gt; with water conversation efforts!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The truth is: Bats are one of the most misunderstood animals. They make up almost a fifth of all mammal series and (Surprise!) play a crucial role in our natural environment. April 17 is Bat Appreciation Day. Let’s learn something about this important friend of mankind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats are found almost everywhere in the world. In Europe alone, for example, there are 45 species and they eat beetles, flies, moths and other insects (with the exception of one – the Egyptian fruit bat.). They contribute to pest control and some also help with seed pollination. However, many of them are under threat from habitat loss and direct persecution due to lack of understanding. Some have even become distinct in certain countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the facts about bats and you will fall in love with them! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.batlife-europe.info/&quot;&gt;BatLife-Europe.info&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource with eye-opening information and beautiful pictures. While you are in the site, don’t forget to check out the adorable but also vulnerable 2015 Bat of the Year that needs help with conservation: Nathusius’ pipistrelle (Pipistrellus nathusii)! &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The How2Recycle Label and website were created to provide consistent and transparent on-package recycling information to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A project of GreenBlue’s Sustainable Packaging Coalition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goals of the How2Recycle were developed through open discussion with numerous stakeholders, and relate to the ultimate vision of a system where valuable packaging materials are beneficially recovered. Our goals are to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce confusion by creating a clear, well-understood, and nationally harmonized label that enables industry to convey to consumers how to recycle a package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the reliability, completeness, and transparency of recyclability claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a labeling system that follows Federal Trade Commission Green Guides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the availability and quality of recycled material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
